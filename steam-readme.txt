Personal tweaks for sp Total War mod. (v1.0.3)
**** List of changes, see also proposed mod list:

* Supply hub lower build cost from 5000 to 3000
* More special forces: +12 battalions flat bonus
* Slightly more volunteers
* Normal difficulty softened a little bit:
__ - organization loss when moving: 40% -> 30%
__ - AI attack & speed bonus: 10% -> 5%
__ - AI research speed buff: +15% -> +10%
* Normal difficulty: slower research: research speed -20% for player & AI (see suggested mod below)
* War goals: little less time & political points required. war goals last longer
* Non-Aligned can send volunteers

**** Why such changes ?
On normal difficulty I want little smaller AI buffs. 
I want world to slow down in general, I want to see & experience more low-level techs / units / doctines in combat. 
    So research speed -20% globally. 
"Bonus Research Reloaded" mod (below) is small research equalizer for weaker nations, 
    it gives you small boost to tech already researched by other powers. 

**** Prepared (forked from) for TW version: 1.10.1 (16.05.2022)
Most features overrides a few org Total War files, so using on next TW versions is a small risk.
